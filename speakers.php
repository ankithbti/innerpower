									<h2>Jeanne-d’Arc Jabbour Rajagopal</h2>

									<p>
										<strong>Jeanne-d’Arc Jabbour Rajagopal</strong> is an Entrepreneur, a Pranic Healer, Pranic Healing Instructor and Arhatic Yoga® Practioner. She has a BA in Sociology with Minor in Psychology and MBA in Marketing from the American University in Dubai.
									</p>

									<p>
										She has diversified experience in the Business World where she has worked with Nestlé, a fortune 50 MNC, for 9 years, in various positions of Sales, Marketing, Project Management and Green Field Projects, handling the Middle East, North Africa and Iran.
									</p>

									<p>
										Despite being very successful according to the social norms and definitions, she felt a big void in her life - something essential missing, a sense of lack of fulfillment and lack of inner peace.
									</p>

									<p>
										She had always had an inclination towards spirituality and read many religious and esoteric books from a young age but couldn’t figure out how to combine everyday life with spirituality. She also knew that it is not practical to give it all up and go live in the mountains.
									</p>

									<p>
										So she decided to take what many considered a drastic step in her life and resigned from Nestlé to focus more on the path of self-discovery and spiritual development. At that point, she took her first class in Pranic Healing.  Those 2 days opened up a whole new world and made her realize that Spirituality and Practicality are not mutually exclusive; in fact, Grand Master Choa Kok Sui (GMCKS), the Founder of Modern Pranic Healing and Arhatic Yoga, is a modern day renaissance man - spiritual guru to thousands, Master Pranic Healer, internationally read author, engineer and scientist, businessman and family man!
									</p>

									<p>
										Since then, she has experienced first-hand, the benefits of Pranic Healing® and Arhatic Yoga® in her life. She now lives in India, is married and together with her husband run their own business (chain of restaurants) based on Spiritual Business Management principles and using the techniques of Pranic Healing and Arhatic Yoga.
									</p>

									<p>
										She is leading a balanced, fulfilled and meaningful life, running her business, teaching Pranic Healing, healing and doing service and volunteering in many of the GMCKS projects in India.
									</p>

									<p>
										Her life then changed from a stress filled life to a life filled with inner peace, calmness and power. She realized that Spirituality can be coupled with practicality and success doesn’t have to be one or the other and is on a mission to share this with all people in the corporate world who want to take charge and lead a fulfilled life.

									<h2>Shwetha Bhatia</h2>

									<p>
										<strong>Shwetha Bhatia</strong> is a registered dietician with the Indian Dietetic Association. She specialises in clinical and sports nutrition. A University topper at the graduation and post graduation level in Dietetics, Shwetha’s academic excellence is superseded by her successful and established clinical practice under the brand name ‘Metamorphosis’. She firmly believes that ‘Prevention is Cheaper than Cure’. In today’s fast paced life, health care management is becoming increasingly important. We are constantly striving to expand our horizons at work. Fitness is directly proportional to peak performance. Therefore, today she is going to focus on Self care and energy management which will yield peak performance.
									</p>

									<p>
										Disease comes with decreased productivity and increased burden of medical cost. The concept of ‘counting calories to achieve your ideal body weight’ is outdated. Your body composition (muscle-to-fat ratio), determines your risk for disease and is the best indicator of how healthy you are.
									</p>

									<p>
										Ideal BODY COMPOSITION can be achieved at any age BUT only through a structured exercise plan and nutrition which supports it. Walking / yoga may not be enough.
									</p>
